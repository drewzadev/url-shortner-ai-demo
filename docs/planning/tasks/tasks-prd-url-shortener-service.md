### Directory Structure Created
- `config/` - Configuration values and settings
- `libs/` - Core infrastructure services (logger, database, redis, bootstrap utility)
- `services/` - Business logic services with dependency injection
- `controllers/` - Route controllers
- `routes/` - Route factory functions
- `views/` and `views/layouts/` - EJS templates
- `public/css/` - Static CSS files
- `middleware/` - Express middleware factory functions
- `utils/` - Utility functions with dependency injection
- `jobs/` - Background jobs
- `test/` with subdirectories - Test files

### Notes

- **Dependency Injection**: All services accept dependencies through constructor parameters for better testability
- **Core Services**: Logger, database, and Redis are created once via `libs/bootstrap.js` and injected into other services
- **Configuration**: Centralized in `config/app.js` instead of scattered environment variable access
- **Factory Pattern**: Routes and middleware are factory functions that accept dependencies
- **Single Connections**: One database connection and one Redis connection managed by the bootstrap utility
- Unit tests should be placed in the `test/` directory with corresponding folder structure
- Use `npm test` to run all tests via Mocha
- Use `npm run lint` to run StandardJS linting
- Environment variables should be configured in `.env` file
- Redis should be pre-populated with short codes on application startup
